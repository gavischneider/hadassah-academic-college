========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program creates a linked list with values that it receives from the user. The program then runs on the list and points every even number to the next even number in the list, and every odd number to the next odd number in the list. If there is no next even or odd number, the number will point to NULL. The program then prints every number, and the number it's pointing at (or "-" if nothing).
