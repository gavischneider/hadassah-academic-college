Pointers to functions - sorting
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives a list of points and a list of rectangles from the user,
including their coordinates. The user will then choose one of four ways to sort
the points and one of three ways to sort the rectangles. The user also chooses 
one of two ways in which the points and rectangles will be printed.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4a.cc –o ex4a
Run: ex4a
Input: 1. Print option (char)
       2. How many points (int)
       3. Point data
       4. How many rectangles (int)
       5. Rectangle data
       6. Point sort option (char)
       7. Rectangle sort option (char)

Output: List of point data and list of rectangle data, after being sorted

Functions to pointers 2 - largest area
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives a list of circles and a list of rectangles from the user,
including their coordinates. The circles and the rectangles will be sorted into
2 separate binary trees. The program then creates 2 arrays to go over the
binary trees and search for the shapes with the largest areas, which are also
calculated. The arrays will then be printed.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4b.cc –o ex4b
Run: ex4b
Input: circle data (until 0 0) and rectangle data (until 0 0 0 0)

Output: list of the circles and rectangles with the largest areas
