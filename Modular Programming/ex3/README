Finding the smallest value and the branches
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives a binary search tree from the user. The program finds
the smallest value in the tree and prints it. The program then searches for
all the branches and prints all their values.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3a.cc –o ex3a
Run: ex3a
Input: A list of numbers, until 0

Output: The smallest value in the tree, and all the values in the branches

Finding the leaf with the shortest distance from the root
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives a list of numbers from the user, and enters them into a
binary tree. The program then finds the leaf with the shortest distance from
the root, and prints its value.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3b.cc –o ex3b
Run: ex3b
Input: A list of numbers

Output: The value of the leaf with the shortest distance from the root

Convert binary tree to a linked list
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives values from, the user and enters them into a binary
tree. The program then 'converts' the tree to a linked list, my moving all the
values to a linked list in ascending order. The program then prints the new
linked list.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex3c.cc –o ex3c
Run: ex3c
Input: A list of numbers

Output: The linked list - all the numbers in ascending order 

Runtime: Number of values in tree
