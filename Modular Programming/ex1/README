Calculating an average in a dynamic matrix
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program dynamically allocates a matrix, according to the size the user 
inputs. The first number is the amount of rows, and after that the user 
enters the size of each individual row. The user then inputs the actual 
values. Afterwards, the program calculates and returns the average of all 
the values in the matrix.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1a.cc –o ex1a
Run: ex1a
Input: The dimensions of the matrix, and it values

Output: The average of all the values

The sum of two dynamic matrices
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives two dynamically allocated matrices, and then combines 
them by adding the sum of the values and printing them.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1b.cc –o ex1b
Run: ex1b
Input: The names of the two files

Output: The combined matrix

Functions on dynamically allocated matrices
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives a dynamically allocated matrix from the user, 
and then gives them the option of performing different functions on the matrix.
 * al: add line
 * dl: delete line
 * jl: join line
 * sl: split line
 * av: add value
 * dv: delete value
 * pr: print array
 * pg: clean array
 * e: exit

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1c.cc –o ex1c
Run: ex1c
Input: The name of the desired function, and then the relevant information that
	the function requires 

Output: pr - prints the matrix, 
	the other functions don't print
