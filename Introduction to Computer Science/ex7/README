Basic functions on strings
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives two string from the user, and then does two things:
 1) Removes all the non letters from the string, and replaces all the lower case letters with upper case letters.
 2) Removes all the letters that appear in string 2 from string 1.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex7a.cc –o ex7a
Run: ex7a
Input: two strings

Output: two strings

Finding an array that contains a matrix
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives a 'dictionary' of up to ten words and a separate string (text). The program then runs over text and searches for the words it contains inside of the dictionary. The program searches for the longest sequence of words and prints where the sequence started, and how long it was. 

Compile: g++ -Wall ex7b.cc –o ex7b
Run: ex7b
Input: dictionary - a matrix [10x8] of chars, and text, a string[100]

Output: 2 ints, length and index

Runtime: MAX_TEXT_LEN * MAX_TEXT_LEN * MAX_STRS



File: ex7c.cc 
Finding mutual substrings
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives two strings from the user. The program then searches for the longest occurring substring found in both strings, and then prints the length of that substring.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex7c.cc –o ex7c
Run: ex7c
Input: two strings

Output: an int = length of the longest substring
