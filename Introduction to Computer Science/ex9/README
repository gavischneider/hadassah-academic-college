========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives 2 numbers from the user and then finds the quickest route from the first number two the second number while only using two different moves: multiplying by two or adding one. This is accomplished by using backtracking in a recursive function.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex9b.cc –o ex9b
Run: ex9b
Input: 2 numbers

Golden Bars
========================================
Writen by: Gavriel Schneider

This program receives 5 'gold bars' (numbers) from the user, and tries to find a way to divide them evenly between 2 groups (meaning the sum of the 2 groups should be equal). This is accomplished via backtracking.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex9b.cc –o ex9b
Run: ex9c
Input: 5 numbers 

Output: The two groups, if a solution is found, otherwise nothing
